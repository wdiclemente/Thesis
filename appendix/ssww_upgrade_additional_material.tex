\section{Plots of other optimization variables}\label{app:sswwupgrade_optimization_plots}
Plots of the remaining optimization variables not shown in Section~\ref{sswwupgrade:opt_results} are presented here for reference.
Figures~\ref{fig:optimized_lep0pt}, \ref{fig:optimized_mll}, and \ref{fig:optimized_mjj} compare signal and background distributions for the default and optimized cuts.
None of these cuts change by much in the optimized selection and their impacts on the overall event selection is minimal.

  \caption{Leading lepton $\pt$ distribution.  The default and optimized cuts are represented by the red and green dashed lines, respectively.  The \ssww EWK signal (black points) is normalized to the same area as the sum of the backgrounds (colored histogram).}
