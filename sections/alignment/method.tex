% define residuals
% alignment levels

The alignment procedure uses track-based algorithm that updates the locations of detector elements in order to minimize the set of track-hit \emph{residuals}.
These residuals are defined as the distance between the fitted track position in a given detector element to the position of the hit recorded by the same element.
Tracks in ATLAS are parameterized as five-dimensional vectors~\cite{2006.atlas-tracking-model}:%follow helical trajectories and are parameterized as five-dimensional vectors~\cite{2006.atlas-tracking-model}:
\begin{equation}
  \vec{\tau} = (d_0,z_0,\phi_0,\theta,q/p)
\end{equation}
where $d_0$ and $z_0$ are the transverse and longitudinal impact parameters with respect to the origin, respectively, $\phi_0$ is the azimuthal angle of the track at the point of closest approach to the origin, $\theta$ is the polar angle, and $q/p$ is the charge of the track divided by its momentum.
The residual for the $i^{\textrm{th}}$ hit of a given track can then be written in terms of the track parameters $\vec{\tau}$ and the alignment parameters $\vec{a}$ that describe the hit location~\cite{2005.global-chi2-alignment}:
\begin{equation}
  r_i(\vec{\tau},\vec{a}) = (\vec{m}_i - \vec{e}_i (\vec{\tau},\vec{a}))\cdot\hat{k}
\end{equation}
where $\vec{e}_i$ is the intersection point of the extrapolated track with the sensor, $\vec{m}_i$ is the position of the associated hit within the sensor, and $\hat{k}$ is the unit vector defining the direction of the measurement within the sensor.
$\vec{r}$ is then the vector of residuals for the given track.
The effect of a misaligned detector element on the track reconstruction and the resulting track-hit residuals is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:alignment_effects_misalign}. \TODO{ there has to be a better way to introduce this figure}

The reconstructed particle track (dashed arrow) differs from the actual trajectory of the particle (solid arrow) due to the shift in one of the detector elements.

\end{figure}

% the alignment constants are those that minimize the track-hit residuals
A $\chi^2$ function can be built from the residuals of all collected tracks:
\begin{equation}
  \chi^2 = \sum\limits_{\textrm{tracks}}\vec{r}^{T}V^{-1}\vec{r}
  \label{eq:alignment_chi2}
\end{equation}
where $V$ is the covariance matrix of the hit measurements.
The $\chi^2$ function is then minimized with respect to the alignment parameters $\vec{a}$, which contain all degrees of freedom being aligned.
The minimzation condition with respect to $\vec{a}$ is:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d\chi^2}{d\vec{a}} = 0 ~~ \rightarrow ~~ 2\sum\limits_{\textrm{tracks}}\bigg(\deriv{\vec{r}}{\vec{a}}\bigg)^{T}V^{-1}\vec{r} = 0
  \label{eq:alignment_chi2_min_condition}
\end{equation}
This equation can be difficult to solve exactly, so the residual is rewritten as a first order Taylor expansion:
\begin{equation}
  %\vec{r} = \vec{r}_0+\frac{\partial\vec{r}}{\partial\vec{\tau}}\delta\vec{\tau}+\frac{\partial\vec{r}}{\partial\vec{a}}\delta\vec{a}
  \vec{r} = \vec{r}_0+\deriv{\vec{r}}{\vec{a}}\delta\vec{a}
  \label{eq:alignment_residual_taylor}
\end{equation}
where $\vec{r}_0$ is dependent on an initial set of track and alignment parameters $\vec{\tau}_0$ and $\vec{a}_0$, respectively; the track parameter dependence has also been folded into the total derivative $\deriv{\vec{r}}{\vec{a}}$.
Equation~\ref{eq:alignment_residual_taylor} can then be inserted into the minimization condition from Equation~\ref{eq:alignment_chi2_min_condition} to give:
\begin{equation}
  \Bigg[ \sum\limits_{\textrm{tracks}}\bigg(\deriv{\vec{r}}{\vec{a}}\bigg)^{T}V^{-1}\deriv{\vec{r}}{\vec{a}} \Bigg]\delta\vec{a} + \sum\limits_{\textrm{tracks}}\bigg(\deriv{\vec{r}}{\vec{a}}\bigg)^{T}V^{-1}\vec{r}_0 = 0
  \label{eq:alignment_chi2_min_taylor}
\end{equation}
From this equation, the alignment matrix $\mathcal{M}_a$ and alignment vector $\vec{\nu}_a$ can be defined:
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{M}_a = \sum\limits_{\textrm{tracks}}\bigg(\deriv{\vec{r}}{\vec{a}}\bigg)^{T}V^{-1}\deriv{\vec{r}}{\vec{a}}
  \label{eq:alignment_matrix}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \vec{\nu}_a = \sum\limits_{\textrm{tracks}}\bigg(\deriv{\vec{r}}{\vec{a}}\bigg)^{T}V^{-1}\vec{r}_0
  \label{eq:alignment_vector}
\end{equation}
Finally, the alignment corrections $\delta\vec{a}$ can be solved for by inverting the alignment matrix:
\begin{equation}
  \delta\vec{a} = -\mathcal{M}_a^{-1}\vec{\nu}_a
  \label{eq:alignment_corrections}
\end{equation}
%The \emph{alignment constants} are the values of $\vec{a}$ that minimize the track-hit residuals.
which is a linear system of equations with a number of equations equal to the number of alignment degrees of freedom.
