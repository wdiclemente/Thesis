  \caption{Graphical representation of the effect of a misaligned detector element.  The reconstructed particle track (dashed arrow) differs from the actual trajectory of the particle (solid arrow) due to the shift in one of the detector elements.  The cyan lines represent the track-to-hit residuals.}
