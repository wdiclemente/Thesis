%Over the course of the next eight years, the LHC and ATLAS will go through two scheduled extended maintenance periods--the Phase-I and Phase-II upgrades--in which the experiment will be upgraded to the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC)

On December 3, 2018, Run 2 of the LHC officialy ended, and the collider was shut down to begin the first of two scheduled extended maintenance periods \cite{2018.cern-press-run2}.
During these two long shutdowns, the Phase-I and Phase-II upgrades of the LHC and ATLAS will occur in order to prepare for the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) which is scheduled to begin operation in 2026 \cite{2011.atlas-phase1-loi}.

The HL-LHC is planned to run at an instantaneous luminosity of $\mathcal{L}=5\times 10^{34}~\textrm{cm}^{-2}\textrm{s}^-1$ with an average of 140 collisions per beam-crossing. 
Over the course of operation, the HL-LHC is expected to collect a total integrated luminosity of $\mathcal{L} = 3000~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ by 2035 \cite{2015.hllhc-design-report}.

These run conditions are much harsher than what ATLAS has experienced so far, and as a result there are several planned upgrades to the detector.
Most notably, the entire ID will be replaced with an all-silicon tracker which will extend the coverage from $|\eta| \le 2.7$ up to $|\eta| \le 4.0$.
This will allow for reconstruction of charged particle tracks which can in turn be matched to clusters in the calorimeters for electron identification or forward jet tagging \cite{2015.atlas-phase2-scoping}.
%There are also plans for additional muon detectors at high rapidity

%While the HL-LHC is still years in the future, it is 
\TODO{Why are we studying ssww at the HL-LHC}

% I don't think we need enough detail on the hllhc upgrades to warrant its own section, we can just mention the main impacts (forward tracking, luminosity, etc)
