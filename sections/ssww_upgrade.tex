%Over the course of the next eight years, the LHC and ATLAS will go through two scheduled extended maintenance periods--the Phase-I and Phase-II upgrades--in which the experiment will be upgraded to the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC)

On December 3, 2018, Run 2 of the LHC officialy ended, and the collider was shut down to begin the first of two scheduled extended maintenance periods \cite{2018.cern-press-run2}.
During these two long shutdowns, the Phase-I and Phase-II upgrades of the LHC and ATLAS will occur in order to prepare for the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) which is scheduled to begin operation in 2026 \cite{2011.atlas-phase1-loi}.

The HL-LHC is planned to run at a center-of-mass energy of \com{14} with an instantaneous luminosity of $\mathcal{L}=5\times 10^{34}~\textrm{cm}^{-2}\textrm{s}^{-1}$ with up to 200 collisions per beam-crossing. 
Over the course of operation, the HL-LHC is expected to collect a total integrated luminosity of $\mathcal{L} = 3000~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ by 2035 \cite{2015.hllhc-design-report}.

These run conditions are much harsher than what ATLAS has experienced so far, and as a result there are several planned upgrades to the detector.
Most notably, the entire ID will be replaced with an all-silicon tracker which will extend the coverage from $|\eta| \le 2.7$ up to $|\eta| \le 4.0$.
This will allow for reconstruction of charged particle tracks which can in turn be matched to clusters in the calorimeters for electron identification or forward jet tagging \cite{2015.atlas-phase2-scoping}.
%There are also plans for additional muon detectors at high rapidity

%While the HL-LHC is still years in the future, it is 
The upgraded detector combined with the higher beam energy and the considerable increase in integrated luminosity means that many analyses with low signal statistics in Run 2 have the potential to be greatly improved with the HL-LHC.
While the ATLAS 13~TeV \ssww cross section measurement certainly did not suffer greatly from low statistics \TODO{--reword--}, the accuracy of the measurement can still be improved at the HL-LHC. % would it become ``systematics limited'' instead of ``statistics limited'' -- look into this, could be good to say if so.
%Additionally, there are expected to be enough signal events to measure the polarization of the produced $W$ bosons.
Of particular interest is the longitudinal polarization of the $W$ bosons due to its sensitivity to electroweak symmetry breaking~\cite{2013.longitudinal-theory}.% which is expected to be measurable for the first time.

The analysis detailed in this chapter is based off of the 2018 public ATLAS \ssww prospects study~\cite{2018.ssww-upgrade} which is itself an extension of the 2017 ATLAS study~\cite{2017.ssww-upgrade}.  \TODO{mention CMS's study + yellow report?}
