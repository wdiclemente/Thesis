%Over the course of the next eight years, the LHC and ATLAS will go through two scheduled extended maintenance periods--the Phase-I and Phase-II upgrades--in which the experiment will be upgraded to the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC)

On December 3, 2018, Run 2 of the LHC officialy ended, and the collider was shut down to begin the first of two scheduled extended maintenance periods~\cite{2018.cern-press-run2}.
During these two long shutdowns, the Phase-I and Phase-II upgrades of the LHC and ATLAS will occur in order to prepare for the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) which is scheduled to begin operation in 2026~\cite{2011.atlas-phase1-loi}.

The HL-LHC is planned to run at a center-of-mass energy of \com{14} with an instantaneous luminosity of $\mathcal{L}=5\times 10^{34}~\textrm{cm}^{-2}\textrm{s}^{-1}$ with up to 200 collisions per beam-crossing. 
Over the course of operation, the HL-LHC is expected to collect a total integrated luminosity of $\mathcal{L} = 3000~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ by 2035~\cite{2015.hllhc-design-report}.

These run conditions will be much harsher than what ATLAS has experienced so far, and there are several upgrades planned to adapt the detector to the high luminosity environment.
Most notably, the entire ID will be replaced with an all-silicon tracker which will extend the coverage from $|\eta| \le 2.7$ up to $|\eta| \le 4.0$.
This will allow for forward particle tracks to be reconstructed, which can in turn be matched to clusters in the calorimeters for use in electron identification or forward jet tagging~\cite{2015.atlas-phase2-scoping}.
%There are also plans for additional muon detectors at high rapidity

%While the HL-LHC is still years in the future, it is 
The upgraded detector, the higher beam energy, and the increased volume of data to be collected provides the opportunity to measure rare processes to a much higher precision than what is possible with the current LCH dataset.
Same-sign \ssww production is one such process.
With greater statistics, the accuracy of the cross section measurement can be improved over the $13\tev$ analysis detailed in Chapter~\ref{ch:ssww13tev}, and it also will allow for more detailed physics studies, such as measuring the polarization state of the scattered $W$ bosons.
% would it become ``systematics limited'' instead of ``statistics limited'' -- look into this, could be good to say if so.
%Additionally, there are expected to be enough signal events to measure the polarization of the produced $W$ bosons.
A measurement of the cross section of longitudinally polarized \ssww scattering is one of the most enticing extensions of the existing \ssww measurements due to its sensitivity to the EWSB mechanism~\cite{2013.longitudinal-theory}, and it is expected to be measurable for the first time at the HL-LHC.
The analysis detailed in this chapter is based off of the 2018 ATLAS HL-LHC \ssww prospects study~\cite{2018.ssww-upgrade} which extends upon the results of the previous year's study~\cite{2017.ssww-upgrade}.  %\TODO{mention CMS's study + yellow report?}
