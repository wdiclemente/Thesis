Due to the non-Abelian nature of the EWK interaction, the associated gauge bosons are allowed to self-interact.
This results in triple and quartic couplings of gauge bosons (TGCs and QGCs, respectively).
The SM allowed TGCs are the $WW\gamma$ and $WWZ$ vertices, which can be measured experimentally via diboson production or through vector boson fusion (VBF).
The QGCs predicted by the SM are $WWZ\gamma$, $WW\gamma\gamma$, $WWZZ$, and $WWWW$, and these vertices are accessible via triboson production or vector boson scattering (VBS)\footnote{Vector boson fusion and scattering typically refer to the $s$-channel and $t$-channel exchanges of a vector boson, respectively; however, often both are used interchangeably to describe the $VV\rightarrow VV$ process.  Therefore, for the remainder of this thesis, \emph{vector boson scattering} will refer to both the VBF and VBS production mechanisms.}~\cite{2017.multiboson-at-lhc}.
VBS processes are defined by a $VV\rightarrow VV$ signature, where $V$ represents one of the EWK gauge bosons ($W^{\pm}$, $Z$, or $\gamma$), as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:theory_generic_vbs}.
The actual interaction between the incoming and outgoing vector bosons can be mediated by the exchange of a virtual $V$, directly via a QGC (both are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:theory_vbs_ewk}), or by the exchange of a Higgs boson (as in Figure~\ref{fig:theory_vbs_higgs}).

As detailed in the previous section, the Higgs mechanism produces three Goldstone bosons and a Higgs boson.
The Goldstone bosons are then ``eaten'' by the physical gauge bosons, giving them mass and consequently a longitudinal polarization\footnote{A massless spin-1 boson can have one of two transverse polarization states, while a massive spin-1 boson can also be longitudinally polarized.  As a result, only the massive $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons, and not the massless photon, are sensitive to EWSB.}.
In fact, according to the Electroweak Equivalence Theorem, the high-energy interactions of longitudinal gauge bosons can be accurately described by the Goldstone bosons of the EWSB mechanism~\cite{1997.ewk-equivalence}.
Thus, the scattering of the massive gauge bosons is inextricably linked to EWSB.

It turns out that without a light SM Higgs boson, the scattering amplitude of longitudinally polarized vector bosons grows with center-of-mass energy and ultimately violates unitarity above $\sqrt{s}\approx 1.2\tev$~\cite{1977.ben-lee-weak-interactions, 2009.strong-gauge-boson-scattering}.
Writing down the equations for the transverse and longitudinal polarization vectors for a gauge boson of mass $M_V$~\cite{1990.strong-ww-scattering}:
\begin{equation}
  \epsilon^{\mu}_{\pm} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(0,0,\pm i, 0)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \epsilon^{\mu}_L &= \frac{1}{M_V}(|\vec{p}|, 0, 0, E)\\
                    &= \frac{p^{\mu}}{M_V}+v^{\mu}
  \end{aligned}
  \label{eq:longitudinal_polarization}
\end{equation}
where $v^{\mu}$ is of the order $M_V/E$ and becomes small in the high energy limit, it can be seen that $\epsilon^{\mu}_{L}$ grows with the momentum of the boson $p^{\mu}$.
Therefore, the dominant contribution to the VBS process at high energy comes from the longitudinally polarized gauge bosons~\cite{2012.vbs-thesis-oord}.

The high-energy behavior of longitudinally polarized vector boson scattering can be explored in the case of opposite-sign $W^{+}W^{-}\rightarrow W^{+}W^{-}$ scattering.
In the high-energy limit ($s \gg M_W^2, M_H^2$), the amplitude of $W^{+}W^{-}$ scattering without considering the Higgs contributions (the appropriate diagrams from Figure~\ref{fig:theory_vbs_ewk}) can be written as~\cite{2009.strong-gauge-boson-scattering}:
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{M}_{\textrm{gauge}} = -\frac{g^2}{4M_W^2}u+\mathcal{O}\Bigg(\bigg[\frac{E}{M_W}\bigg]^0\Bigg)
  \label{eq:theory_longitudinal_m_gauge}
\end{equation}
where $g$ is the EWK coupling and $u$ is one of the Mandelstam variables (the others being $s$ and $t$).
The $\mathcal{O}(E^4)$ terms cancel out between the TGC and QGC diagrams~\cite{2012.vbs-thesis-oord}.
What is left is an amplitude proportional to $E^2$ that diverges as $E/M_W\rightarrow\infty$.
However, the amplitude from the diagrams involving the Higgs boson (the relevant diagrams from Figure~\ref{fig:theory_vbs_higgs}) is:
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{M}_{\textrm{Higgs}} = -\frac{g^2}{4M_W^2}\bigg[\frac{(s-M_W^2)^2}{s-m_H^2}+\frac{(t-M_W^2)^2}{t-M_H^2}\bigg]
\end{equation}
which, in the high-energy limit, reduces to:
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{M}_{\textrm{Higgs}} = \frac{g^2}{4M_W^2}u+\mathcal{O}\Bigg(\bigg[\frac{E}{M_W}\bigg]^0\Bigg)
  \label{eq:theory_longitudinal_m_higgs}
\end{equation}
Adding the two equations together cancels out the $E^2$ term and leaves only terms constant in energy.
Therefore, with a SM Higgs, the scattering amplitude for longitudinally polarized $W$ bosons no longer diverges.
Plots of the cross section of several $VV\rightarrow VV$ scattering processes are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:theory_vbs_xsec_higgs} with and without a SM Higgs boson.
