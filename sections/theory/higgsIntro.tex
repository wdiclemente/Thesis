When the theory of the electroweak interaction was first developed \cite{1959.Glashow.vector-mesons, 1959.Salam.electroweak},
the $W$ and $Z$ bosons were predicted to be massless (a typical mass term in the Lagrangian would violate the SU(2) symmetry).
However, these were experimentally observed to have masses...
