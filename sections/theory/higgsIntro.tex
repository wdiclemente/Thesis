%When the theory of the electroweak interaction was first developed \cite{1959.Glashow.vector-mesons, 1959.Salam.electroweak},
%the $W$ and $Z$ bosons were predicted to be massless (a typical mass term in the Lagrangian would violate the SU(2) symmetry).
%However, these were experimentally observed to have masses...

The results of electroweak mixing and the implications of the Higgs field have been introduced in the previous section.
If the EWK theory were an unbroken symmetry, the associated $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons would be massless; however, when first observed experimentally~\cite{1983.w-boson, 1983.z-boson}, they were found to be quite heavy; currently, their masses are known to be approximately $80\gev$ and $91\gev$, respectively~\cite{2014.pdg}.
The following presents the Higgs mechanism, including how it ``spontaneously breaks'' the EWK symmetry, resulting in the massive $W^\pm$ and $Z$ bosons and the massless photon.

Beginning by writing the Higgs field as a complex scalar doublet %$\phi$
\begin{equation}
  \phi = 
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \phi^{+} \\
    \phi^{0}
  \end{pmatrix}
  = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \phi_1 + i\phi_2 \\
    \phi_3 + i\phi_4
  \end{pmatrix}\,,
  \label{eq:complex_scalar_doublet}
\end{equation}
a simple Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}$ can be written as
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L} = (\mathcal{D}_\mu\phi)^\dagger (\mathcal{D}^\mu\phi) - \mu^2\phi^{\dagger}\phi-\lambda (\phi^{\dagger}\phi)^2\,,
  \label{eq:complex_scalar_lagrangian}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda > 0$ and $\mu^2$ are constants (the sign of $\mu^2$ will be addressed shortly).
$\mathcal{D}_{\mu}$ is the covariant derivative defined such that $\mathcal{L}$ is invariant under a local $\gtsu{2}\times\gtu{1}$ gauge transformation:
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{D}_{\mu}\phi = \bigg(\partial_{\mu} + \frac{ig}{2}\tau_a W_{\mu}^a + \frac{ig'}{2}B_{\mu}\bigg)\phi\,.
  \label{eq:covariant_deriv}
\end{equation}
Here, $W_{\mu}^a$ ($a=1,2,3$) are the $\gtsu{2}$ fields with generators $\tau_a$ and coupling constant $g$, and $B_{\mu}$ is the $\gtu{1}$ field with coupling constant $g'$.

Isolating the Lagrangian's potential term,
\begin{equation}
  V(\phi) = \mu^2\phi^{\dagger}\phi+\lambda(\phi^{\dagger}\phi)^2\,,
  \label{eq:higgs_potential}
\end{equation}
a choice must be made on the sign of $\mu^2$.
The case of interest is when $\mu^2 < 0$, which results in the so-called ``Mexican hat potential'' shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mexican_hat}.
The potential is minimized along the collection of points
\begin{equation}
  \phi^{\dagger}\phi = \frac{1}{2}\big(\phi_1^2 + \phi_2^2 + \phi_3^2 + \phi_4^2\big) = -\frac{\mu^2}{2\lambda}\,.
  \label{eq:higgs_minimum}
\end{equation}
This means that the minimum of the potential is not at $\phi = 0$ (as it would be in the case where $\mu^2 > 0$), but rather at a value
\begin{equation}
  v \equiv \sqrt{-\frac{\mu^2}{\lambda}}\,.
  \label{eq:higgs_minimum_value}
\end{equation}
With no loss of generality due to the $\gtsu{2}$ symmetry, $\phi_1 = \phi_2 = \phi_4 = 0$ can be imposed on Equation~\ref{eq:higgs_minimum}, leaving $\phi_3^2 = v^2$.
Finally, the \emph{vacuum expectation value} (VEV) of the field can be written:
\begin{equation}
  \langle\phi\rangle = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}
  \begin{pmatrix}
  0 \\ v
  \end{pmatrix}\,.
  \label{eq:vev}
\end{equation}

  \caption{An illustration of the potential term $V(\phi)$ in Equation~\ref{eq:higgs_potential} for the cases where $\mu^2>0$ (left) and $\mu^2<0$ (right).  The right-hand plot shows the Higgs potential, or ``Mexican hat potential'', with the minimum at $|\phi| = \sqrt{-\frac{\mu^2}{\lambda}}$ rather than at $|\phi| = 0$ as in the left-hand plot.}
  \label{fig:mexican_hat}
\end{figure}

The VEV can be substituted back into the original Lagrangian of Equation~\ref{eq:complex_scalar_lagrangian}, and, following quite a bit of math~\cite{1984.halzen-martin}, a collection of mass terms can be identified:
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L} \subset \mathcal{L}_M \equiv \frac{1}{8}v^{2}g^{2}\bigg[\big(W_{\mu}^1\big)^2 + \big(W_{\mu}^2\big)^2\bigg] + \frac{1}{8}v^2\bigg[g^{2}\big(W_{\mu}^3\big)^2 - 2gg'W_{\mu}^{3}B^{\mu} + g'^{2}\big(B_{\mu}\big)^{2}\bigg]\,.
  \label{eq:higgs_mass_1}
\end{equation}
Focusing on the first term for the moment, if Equation~\ref{eq:w_mixing} for the physical $W^\pm$ bosons is substituted in, the mass term becomes
\begin{equation}
  M_W^{2}W^{+}W^{-} = \bigg(\frac{1}{2}vg\bigg)^{2}W^{+}W^{-}\,,
\end{equation}
which then simplifies to
\begin{equation}
  M_W = \frac{1}{2}vg\,.
\end{equation}
With a bit of clever forward-thinking, the second term of Equation~\ref{eq:higgs_mass_1} can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}
  \frac{1}{8}v^{2}\bigg[gW_{\mu}^{3} - g'B_{\mu}\bigg]^2 + 0\bigg[g'W_{\mu}^{3} - gB_{\mu}\bigg]^2 =  \frac{1}{2}M_{Z}^{2}Z_{\mu}^{2} + \frac{1}{2}M_{A}^{2}A_{\mu}^{2}\,,
  \label{eq:higgs_mass_2}
\end{equation}
where $Z_{\mu}^{2}$ and $A_{\mu}^2$ represent the physical $Z$ boson and photon, respectively:
\begin{equation}
 Z_{\mu} = \frac{gW_{\mu}^{3} - g'B_{\mu}}{\sqrt{g^2+g'^2}}
  \label{eq:higgs_z}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  A_{\mu} = \frac{g'W_{\mu}^{3} - gB_{\mu}}{\sqrt{g^2+g'^2}}\,.
  \label{eq:higgs_a}
\end{equation}
From this, it can be seen that the photon is massless ($M_A = 0$ in Equation~\ref{eq:higgs_mass_2}), and the mass of the $Z$ boson is identified as
\begin{equation}
  M_Z = \frac{1}{2}v\sqrt{g^2+g'^2}\,.
\end{equation}

Lastly, the Higgs field can couple directly to the fermions.
Taking the electron as an example, an additional Lagrangian term can be written:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_e = -G_e \big[\bar{e}_{L}\phi e_R+\bar{e}_R\phi^{\dagger}e_L\big]\,,
\end{equation}
where $e_L$ and $e_R$ are the left-handed doublet and right-handed singlet, respectively, and $\phi$ is as in Equation~\ref{eq:complex_scalar_doublet}.
The symmetry can be spontaneously broken by a perturbation about the VEV of the form
\begin{equation}
  \phi = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}
  \begin{pmatrix}
  0 \\ v+h(x)
  \end{pmatrix}\,.
\end{equation}
$\mathcal{L}_e$ then becomes
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathcal{L}_e &= -\frac{G_e}{\sqrt{2}}v\big(\bar{e}_{L}e_{R}+\bar{e}_{R}e_{L}\big) - \frac{G_e}{\sqrt{2}}\big(\bar{e}_{L}e_{R}+\bar{e}_{R}e_{L}\big)h \\
                  &= -m_e\bar{e}e-\frac{m_e}{v}\bar{e}eh\,,
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
which gives a value for the electron mass of $m_e = \frac{G_{e}v}{\sqrt{2}}$.
From the second term above, it can be seen that the strength of the Higgs coupling to the electron is proportional to the mass of the electron.
The rest of the fermion couplings follow from this example.

What is accomplished here is quite remarkable.
The weak and electromagnetic interactions have been unified into a single $\gtsu{2}\times\gtu{1}$ interaction, and the physical bosons observed in nature arise as mixtures of the four gauge fields.
Three of the four degrees of freedom in the scalar field $\phi$ of Equation~\ref{eq:complex_scalar_doublet}, are absorbed (or ``eaten'') by the $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons, giving them a longitudinal polarization mode corresponding to a massive particle, and the fourth generates the Higgs boson.
This process is summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:higgs_dof}.
Additionally, it is shown that the Higgs couples to fermions in proportion to their mass.
From experimental measurements, the value of the VEV has been determined to be $v\approx 246\gev$~\cite{2014.pdg}.
However, it should be noted that the theory does not predict the mass of the Higgs boson or of the fermions; these must all be determined from experiment.
