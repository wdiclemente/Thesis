\subsection{Theoretical overview of vector boson scattering}\label{ssww13tev:vbs_theory}
VBS processes are very important to understand due to their sensitivity to the EWSB mechanism.
The scattering amplitude of longitudinally polarized vector bosons grows with center-of-mass energy and ultimately violates unitarity above \com{1} in the absence of a light SM Higgs boson~\cite{1977.ben-lee-weak-interactions, 2009.strong-gauge-boson-scattering}.
However, once the Higgs is introduced, the divergences cancel and the cross section no longer grows unbounded, as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:ssww13tev_vbs_xsec_higgs}, which consists of plots from~\cite{2008.vbs-resonances-unitarity}.

With the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012~\cite{HIGG-2012-27, CMS-HIG-12-028}, the EWSB mechanism can now be directly studied.
Due to the exchange of a Higgs in the $s$- and $t$-channel VBS diagrams (\ssww specifically only contains the $t$-channel diagram), VBS processes can directly measure properties of the Higgs.
For example, the high-mass tail in the $VV$ scattering system allows an approximation of the effective coupling strength of the Higgs to vector bosons that is independent of any assumptions on the Higgs width~\cite{2015.higgs-constraints-from-vbs}.
Additionally, the center-of-mass energy dependence of the $VV$ scattering can reveal whether the Higgs boson unitarizes the longitudinal scattering amplitude fully or only partially~\cite{2014.higgs-WW-scattering-theory}.

VBS events are characterized by two quarks from the colliding protons each radiating a massive vector boson which then scatter and decay in the detector.
These high-momentum quarks only deflect a small amount upon radiating the vector boson; as a result, they often travel very close to the beam line.
Ignoring the decay products of the bosons, these VBS events result in a final state of two vector bosons ($V$) and two jets ($j$) at high pseudorapidities (called \emph{forward jets}) from the outgoing quarks.
The shorthand $VVjj$ is used to represent this final state.

These $VVjj$ events can be produced via two different physical processes.
The first involves purely electroweak interactions in the tree-level diagrams, with $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{\textrm{EWK}}) = 6$ %(including the decays of the bosons).
and will be referred to as \emph{EWK production}.
This can be further broken down into VBS and non-VBS production.
In the VBS EWK production, the scattering occurs via triple or quartic gauge couplings, as well as the $s$- or $t$-channel exchange of a Higgs boson.
%These diagrams are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ssww13tev_diagrams_vbs}.
The non-VBS EWK production contains the same final state of two vector bosons and two outgoing quarks, but the bosons do not scatter.
Due to gauge invariance, it is not possible to separate the VBS from the non-VBS productions~\cite{2006.isolating-vbs-lhc}; therefore, both are included in the signal generation and are indistinguishable from one another.
The second process involves a mix of the EWK and strong interactions, of order $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s) = 2 \otimes \mathcal{O}(\alpha_{\textrm{EWK}}) = 4$ and will be referred to as \emph{QCD production}.
The tree-level Feynman diagrams for VBS EWK, non-VBS EWK, and QCD $VVjj$ production are found in Figures~\ref{fig:ssww13tev_diagrams_vbs}, \ref{fig:ssww13tev_diagrams_ewk}, and \ref{fig:ssww13tev_diagrams_qcd}, respectively.

Using the \tt{SHERPA} Monte Carlo (MC) generator, leading order cross sections at \com{8} are calculated for a variety of diboson processes
For example, even though the total cross section of opposite-sign $WW$ production is considerably larger than that of same-sign $WW$, the ratio of EWK to QCD production is approximately 3\%
%Therefore, all production modes for \ssww are studied together, with specific selection criteria designed to preferentially select events with a VBS signature.

There are several advantages to studying the same-sign $WW$ process specifically.
The final state's net charge of $\pm 2$ helps considerably in reducing the number of background processes that can mimic the signal.

\subsection{Same-sign $W^{\pm}W^{\pm}$ scattering}\label{ssww13tev:ssww_topology}

The process of interest is the production of two $W$ bosons with the same electric charge and two jets.
For the purposes of this analysis, only the case where both bosons decay leptonically to electrons or muons is considered, which results in a final state with two same charge leptons, two neutrinos, and two jets.

% i think i really only need to include the vbs diagrams for ssww (maybe also the ewk?) since the general VV ones are above for all processes
