\subsection{Experimental overview of vector boson scattering}\label{ssww13tev:vbs_theory}
VBS processes are very important to understand due to their sensitivity to the EWSB mechanism.
As explained in Section~\ref{sec:theory_vbs}, in the absence of a light SM Higgs boson, the scattering amplitude of longitudinally polarized vector bosons grows with center-of-mass energy. % and ultimately violates unitarity above \com{1} in the absence of a light SM Higgs boson.
However, once the Higgs is introduced, the divergences cancel and the cross section no longer grows unbounded. %~\cite{1977.ben-lee-weak-interactions, 2009.strong-gauge-boson-scattering}. % i already cited these guys earlier when saying the same thing

With the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012~\cite{HIGG-2012-27, CMS-HIG-12-028}, the EWSB mechanism can now be directly studied.
Due to the potential exchange of a Higgs boson in the VBS diagrams (\ssww itself does not contain the $s$-channel diagram), VBS processes are directly sensitive to properties of the Higgs.
For example, the high-mass tail in the $VV$ scattering system allows an approximation of the effective coupling strength of the Higgs to vector bosons that is independent of any assumptions on the Higgs width~\cite{2015.higgs-constraints-from-vbs}.
Additionally, the center of mass energy dependence of the $VV$ scattering can reveal whether the Higgs boson unitarizes the longitudinal scattering amplitude fully or only partially~\cite{2014.higgs-WW-scattering-theory}.

VBS events are characterized by two quarks from the colliding protons each radiating a vector boson which then scatter and decay in the detector.
The incoming quarks carry a large amount of momentum and only deflect a small amount upon emitting the vector boson; as a result, they often enter the calorimeters very close to the beam line.
Ignoring the decay products of the scattered bosons for now, these VBS events result in a final state of two vector bosons ($V$) and two jets ($j$) at high pseudorapidities (called \emph{forward jets} or \emph{tag jets}) from the outgoing quarks.
The shorthand $VVjj$ is used to represent this final state.
%A visual representation of a typical event topology for a \ssww event can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:ssww13tev_event_topology}.

$VVjj$ events can be produced via two different physical processes.
The first involves purely electroweak interactions in the tree-level diagrams, with $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{\textrm{EWK}}) = 6$ %(including the decays of the bosons).
and will be referred to as \emph{EWK production}.
This can be further broken down into VBS and non-VBS production.
In the VBS EWK production, the scattering occurs via triple or quartic gauge couplings, as well as the $s$- or $t$-channel exchange of a Higgs boson.
%These diagrams are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ssww13tev_diagrams_vbs}.
The non-VBS EWK production contains the same final state of two vector bosons and two outgoing quarks, but the bosons do not scatter.
Due to gauge invariance, it is not possible to separate the VBS from the non-VBS productions~\cite{2006.isolating-vbs-lhc}; therefore, both are included in the signal generation and are indistinguishable from one another.
The second process involves a mix of the EWK and strong interactions, of order $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s) = 2 \otimes \mathcal{O}(\alpha_{\textrm{EWK}}) = 4$ and will be referred to as \emph{QCD production}.
The tree-level Feynman diagrams for VBS EWK, non-VBS EWK, and QCD $VVjj$ production are found in Figures~\ref{fig:ssww13tev_diagrams_vbs}, \ref{fig:ssww13tev_diagrams_ewk}, and \ref{fig:ssww13tev_diagrams_qcd}, respectively.

\subsection{Same-sign $W^{\pm}W^{\pm}$ scattering}\label{ssww13tev:ssww_topology}
Same-sign \ssww scattering is considered to be one of the best channels for studying VBS at the LHC due to its favorable ratio of EWK to QCD production~\cite{2015.higgs-constraints-from-vbs}.
Since the VBS diagrams (which are a subset of the total EWK production) are the primary source of interest for an analysis, the QCD production would be considered a background in an analysis.
Therefore a higher EWK-to-QCD ratio results in increased sensitivity to VBS.
%This is due primarily to the ratio of the EWK to the QCD production, which matters a great deal due to the VBS events being a subset of the total EWK production.
%In an analysis the EWK production would be conisdered the signal and the QCD production a background, so a favorable ratio of the two helps greatly when comparing the size of the signal to the backgrounds.
EWK and QCD cross sections at \com{13} for six leptonic $VVjj$ final states were calculated using the \tt{SHERPA} MC generator in a VBS-enriched fiducial phase space in~\cite{2014.ssww-thesis-gumpert}.
Despite its relatively low total cross section compared to some other $VVjj$ processes, the EWK-to-QCD ratio for \ssww is 10-20 times higher than for other processes after applying VBS-enhancing selection criteria.

%There are several advantages to studying the same-sign $WW$ process specifically.
%The final state's net charge of $\pm 2$ helps considerably in reducing the number of background processes that can mimic the signal.

This analysis studies \ssww scattering where both $W$ bosons decay leptonically to $e\nu$ or $\mu\nu$\footnote{Throughout the rest of this chapter, unless stated otherwise, $l$ denotes either electrons ($e$) or muons ($\mu$), and $\nu$ denotes a neutrino.  Additionally, $e$, $\mu$, and $\nu$ with no charge or anti-particle designation refer interchangeably to either the particle or anti-particle.}.
The \ssww VBS final state consists of two leptons with the same electric charge, two neutrinos, and two high energy forward jets with a large invariant mass.
Tree-level Feynman diagrams of VBS \ssww production can be found in Figure~\ref{fig:ssww13tev_diagrams_vbs_ssww} and a visual representation of the VBS topology can be found in Figure~\ref{fig:ssww13tev_event_topology}.

The two tag jets in the characteristic VBS signature also serve as a powerful tool to suppress the QCD production mode.
In EWK events, the two jets tend to have much higher separation and a larger combined invariant mass than the two leading jets in a QCD event.
The two plots shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ssww13tev_dijet_comparison} highlight the differences in these dijet quantities between the two production modes.
An ATLAS event display of a real \ssww candidate event is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ssww13tev_event_display_mm}.

\subsection{Overview of backgrounds}\label{ssww13tev:background_overview}
In addition to QCD production of \ssww events, there are several other processes that can end up with a final state of two same-sign leptons, two neutrinos, and two jets.
However, due to the $\pm 2$ final state charge, there is a considerable reduction in SM backgrounds (such as $Z$ boson events) when compared to an analysis like opposite-sign \oswwjj.

One of the largest sources of background involves processes with prompt leptons\footnote{Prompt leptons are those that are produced in the primary collision and are a direct decay product of the process of interest.  Non-prompt leptons originate from some secondary process, such as a $b$-hadron decay, or are jets that get mis-reconstructed as a lepton.}.
These are events that contain two leptons with the same electric charge and one or more additional leptons that are ``lost'', either by failing the selection criteria or falling outside of the detector's acceptance.
The number of processes that can contribute is limited by the requirement of same-sign leptons, and as a result this background is dominated by processes involving two or more vector bosons, with the largest contribution coming from $WZ$ events and smaller contributions from $ZZ$ and $t\bar{t}+V$ events.
Triboson events where one boson decays hadronically also contribute to this background; however, the jets are generally softer and more central than in a typical VBS event, and the cuts applied on the forward jets suppress these contributions.

The other dominant background comes from non-prompt, or ``fake'', leptons.
Here one or more leptons originate from the decay of another particle unrelated to the signal process, such as a heavy-flavor decay or photon conversion, or come from a jet that is misidentified as a lepton.
This background is mostly made up of events from $t\bar{t}$ and $W$+jets processes, with a much smaller contribution from conversions in $V\gamma$ events. %\TODO{check whether $V\gamma$ really qualifies as non-prompt, we lump $Z\gamma$ in with the charge flip background in the paper...}

Finally, opposite-sign lepton pairs can enter the signal region if one of the leptons is reconstructed with the wrong charge (called \emph{charge misidentification}\footnote{Charge misidentification is also referred to interchangeably as \emph{charge mis-ID} and \emph{charge flip}.}).
In practice, this only affects events with electrons, as the charge misidentification rate for muons is negligible~\cite{2013.muon-flip}.
This is a major background in events with two electrons, but is a much smaller contribution for events with one electron and one muon.
