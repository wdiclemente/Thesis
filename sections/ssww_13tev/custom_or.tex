The dominant source of prompt background in this analysis comes from $WZ$ events where both bosons decay leptonically.
Traditionally, the background is dealt with by imposing a veto on any event with a third lepton passing some loose identification criteria (the so-called \emph{trilepton veto}).
In the case of this analysis, if one or more leptons (in addition to the two signal leptons) passed the preselection criteria, the event would be rejected.
However, $WZ$ events can still enter the signal region if one of the leptons fails the veto selection or falls outside of the detector's acceptance.

In order to understand the sources of $WZ$ events that are not removed by the trilepton veto, a study was performed on truth-level leptons\footnote{Truth particles are the particles produced directly by the MC generator before being passed through the full detector simulation, at which point they are considered \emph{reconstruction-level} (or \emph{reco-level}) particles.} on \ssww and $WZ$ MC samples.
Events with three truth leptons were selected, and each was matched to its reconstruction-level partner by finding the closest $\deltar(\textrm{truth},\textrm{reco})$ and $\Delta p_{\textrm{T},\textrm{truth},\textrm{reco}}$ match.
For events surviving the trilepton veto, the two signal leptons were removed, and the remaining leptons represent real leptons that failed to be selected for the veto.
Between 40-50\% of these leptons fell outside of the eta acceptance of the analysis (see Figure~\ref{fig:ssww13tev_wzveto_truthlepeta}) and were unrecoverable.
The second largest source of leptons failing the preselection was the overlap removal (OR). \TODO{Make sure to define overlap removal in the event selection section!}
The standard OF procedure appeared to be too aggressive in removing leptons in favor of jets, causing many three lepton events to ``lose'' their third lepton and pass the trilepton veto.
