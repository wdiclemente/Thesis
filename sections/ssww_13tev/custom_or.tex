The dominant source of prompt background in this analysis comes from $WZ$ events where both bosons decay leptonically.
Traditionally, the background is dealt with by imposing a veto on any event with a third lepton passing some loose identification criteria (the so-called \emph{trilepton veto}).
In the case of this analysis, if one or more leptons (in addition to the two signal leptons) passed the preselection criteria, the event would be rejected.
However, $WZ$ events can still enter the signal region if one of the leptons fails the veto selection or falls outside of the detector's acceptance.

In order to understand the sources of $WZ$ events that are not removed by the trilepton veto, a study was performed on truth-level leptons\footnote{Truth particles are the particles produced directly by the MC generator before being passed through the full detector simulation, at which point they are considered \emph{reconstruction-level} (or \emph{reco-level}) particles.} on \ssww and $WZ$ MC samples.
Events with three truth leptons were selected, and each was matched to its reconstruction-level partner by finding the closest $\deltar(\textrm{truth},\textrm{reco})$ and $\Delta p_{\textrm{T},\textrm{truth},\textrm{reco}}$ match.
For events surviving the trilepton veto, the two signal leptons were removed, and the remaining leptons represent real leptons that failed to be selected for the veto.
Between 40-50\% of these leptons fell outside of the eta acceptance of the analysis (see Figure~\ref{fig:ssww13tev_wzveto_truthlepeta}) and were unrecoverable.
The second largest source of leptons failing the preselection was the OR, defined in Section~\ref{ssww13tev:overlap_removal}.
The standard OF procedure appeared to be too aggressive in removing leptons in favor of jets, causing many three lepton events to ``lose'' their third lepton and pass the trilepton veto.
Therefore a \emph{Custom OR} was investigated which would replace the standard OR in the preselection and allow for better $WZ$ rejection by removing fewer third leptons.

In order to construct a ``custom'' OR, a new quantity is defined between a lepton ($l$) and a nearby jet ($j$)
\begin{equation}
  \ptratio(l,j) = \frac{{\pt}_l}{{\pt}_j}%\pt(l)/\pt(j)
  \label{eq:ssww13tev_ptratio}
\end{equation}
which, along with $\deltar(l,j)$, will allow for more third leptons to pass the preselection.
The idea behind including $\ptratio$ is to be able to preferentially remove background leptons originating from jets (i.e. those that carry a low percentage of the total jet momentum) instead of removing \emph{any} lepton near to jet.
The distributions of $\ptratio$ and the associated efficiency curves for muons and electrons can be found in Figures~\ref{fig:ssww13tev_ptratio_muon} and \ref{fig:ssww13tev_ptratio_elec}, respectively, and the distributions for $\deltar(\mu,j)$ for muons can be found in Figure~\ref{fig:ssww13tev_drlj_muon}.
Since all electrons have an associated jet in the calorimeters, the $\deltar(e,j)$ variable is not a good quantity to use for this custom OR.

A workingpoint for the Custom OR was chosen by requiring 90\% signal retention for muons and 90\% background rejection for electrons.
The cut on electrons was allowed to be much tighter because the number of signal events with a third electron is considerably smaller than for muons.
It should be re-emphasized the signal events that are present in Figures~\ref{fig:ssww13tev_ptratio_muon}-\ref{fig:ssww13tev_ptratio_elec} do not represent the full set of signal events, but only those with a real third lepton (which must come from some source other than the signal \ssww process).
For muons, an or of $\ptratio(\mu,j)$ and $\deltar(\mu,j)$ is used to maximize the third lepton acceptance due to correlations between the quantities, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ssww13tev_customor_muon_2d}; for electrons, only a cut on $\ptratio(e,j)$ is used.
The Custom OR workingpoint is outlined in Table~\ref{tab:custom_or_definition}.

Tests of the performance of the Custom OR yield promising results, with approximately 20\% reduction in $WZ$ background compared to less than 2\% signal loss in the signal region.
Unfortunately, due to differences between the primary analysis framework and the one used for testing, in practice the gains in $WZ$ rejection are not nearly as substantial, and ultimately the Custom OR is not included in the final analysis.
However, it is still a potentially useful tool for improving background rejection via lepton number vetoes in analyses with overly aggressive OR procedures.
