This thesis presents two studies of electroweak same-sign \ssww scattering with the ATLAS experiment.
The first is a measurement of the fiducial cross section at \com{13} using $36.1~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of data recorded in 2015 and 2016.
The electroweak production is observed with a signal significance of $6.9\sigma$, and the fiducial cross section is measured to be $\sigma_{\textrm{meas}}^{\textrm{fid}}~=~2.91^{+0.51}_{-0.47}(\textrm{stat})~^{+0.28}_{-0.29}(\textrm{sys})~\textrm{fb}$.
The second is a study on the future prospects for the \ssww process at the planned High-Luminosity LHC, with a projected \com{14} and $3000~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of data.
The expected electroweak production cross section is determined with a total uncertainty  of $6\%$, and the purely longitudinal scattering component is extracted with an expected significance of $1.8\sigma$.
Finally, some time is taken to detail the alignment of the ATLAS Inner Detector subsystems, as good alignment performance is essential for making high-quality physics measurements.
