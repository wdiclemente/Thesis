The theoretical motivation for studying the ssWW process is detailed in Section~\ref{ssww13tev:vbs_theory}.
\TODO{Re-write this section referencing the main description in the 13tev section. Maybe just turn this into a 1 or 2 sentence refresher}
The particular interest in polarization is the potential for the scattering amplitude of longitudinally polarized weak bosons to diverge linearly as the center of mass energy increases, ultimately violating unitarity around $1\tev$ \cite{1977.ben-lee-weak-interactions}.
In the Standard Model, the Higgs boson cancels these divergences.
However, as the Higgs is recently discovered it is still extremely to study the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB), and the longitudinal scattering of $W$ bosons is expected to be one of the most sensitive tests of EWSB~\cite{2013.longitudinal-theory}.

%some additional detail on the interest in the longitudinally polarized $W$ bosons follows \cite{2016.ssww-polarization, 2013.longitudinal-theory, 2017.multiboson-at-lhc}.

\subsection{Experimental sensitivity to longitudinal polarization}\label{sec:sswwupgrade_longitudinal_sens}
\TODO{mention that since there are so many polarization possibilities, a large integrated luminosity is needed to measure just one of them individually}
There are three possible polarization states for a massive vector boson: two transverse ($+$ or $-$) and one longitudinal ($0$).
Therefore, in a system with two $W$ bosons, the overall polarization can be purely longitudinal ($00$), purely transverse ($++$, $--$, and $+-$), or mixed ($+0$ and $-0$).
The three combinations will be referred to as \emph{LL}, \emph{TT}, and \emph{LT} respectively.

In order extract the longitudinal scattering component, it is necessary to find variables that distinguish the LL from the TT and LT.
Several variables were studied, and those with the best discriminating power between the polarizations were the leading and subleading lepton $\pt$ as well as the azimuthal separation ($|\dphijj|$) of the two VBS jets.
The LL events preferred lower $\pt$ for both signal leptons (see Figure~\ref{fig:polarization_leppt}), which motivates keeping these two cuts as low as possible in the event selection in order to preserve as much longitudinal polarization as possible.
In the case of $|\dphijj|$, the LL events generally had a larger dijet separation (see Figure~\ref{fig:polarization_dphijj}), and this variable is used in a binned likelihood fit to extract the longitudinal scattering significance.
