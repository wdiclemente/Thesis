The motivation for studying the \ssww process as well as VBS in general has been established previously in Sections~\ref{sec:theory_vbs} and \ref{ssww13tev:vbs_theory}.
Since only the longitudinally polarized vector bosons that is sensitive to the EWSB mechanism, a direct measurement of this cross section will be very useful for understanding how the Higgs unitarizes the scattering ampiltude~\cite{2013.longitudinal-theory}.

\subsection{Experimental sensitivity to longitudinal polarization}\label{sec:sswwupgrade_longitudinal_sens}
%\TODO{mention that since there are so many polarization possibilities, a large integrated luminosity is needed to measure just one of them individually}

There are three possible polarization states for a massive vector boson: two transverse ($+$ or $-$) and one longitudinal ($0$).
Therefore, in a system with two $W$ bosons, the overall polarization can be purely longitudinal ($00$), purely transverse ($++$, $--$, and $+-$), or mixed ($+0$ and $-0$).
The three combinations will be referred to as \emph{LL}, \emph{TT}, and \emph{LT} respectively.

In order extract the longitudinal scattering component, it is necessary to find variables that can help distinguish the LL from the TT and LT events.
Several were studied, and those with the best discriminating power between the different polarization states are the leading and subleading lepton transverse momenta as well as the azimuthal separation of the two VBS jets $|\dphijj|$.
Both leptons in LL events tend to be softer than the TT and LT events (see Figure~\ref{fig:polarization_leppt}), which motivates keeping cuts on the lepton $\pt$ as low as possible in the event selection. % in order to preserve as much longitudinal polarization as possible.
In the case of the dijet separation, LL events prefer the tag jets to be back-to-back (see Figure~\ref{fig:polarization_dphijj}).
The $|\Delta\phi_{jj}|$ distribution is chosen to be the discriminating variable between the polarizations, and it is ultimately passed to a binned likelihood fit to extract the longitudinal scattering significance.
