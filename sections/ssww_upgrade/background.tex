In this analysis, all background contributinos are estimated using MC simulations.
Backgrounds such as electron charge misidentification and fake electrons from jets--which are traditionally estimated using data-driven techniques--are estimated using a set of parameterization functions applied to the MC.
These functions calculate the probability that an electron is assigned the wrong charge or a jet is mis-reconstructed as an electron parameterized by the $\pt$ and $\eta$ of the electron or jet.
The probabilites are derived from studies on expected electron performance with the upgraded ATLAS detector~\cite{2016.upgrade-electron-performance}.

Processes involving two $W$ and $Z$ bosons are grouped together as \emph{diboson} backgrounds, with the exception of \ssww events produced via QCD interactions, which are kept separate.
Similarly, all backgrounds with three vector bosons are combined and labeled as \emph{triboson}.
Any $W$+jets or top events that pass selection and do not contain a fake electron, as well as any $Z$+jets events without an electron identifed as having its charge misidentified are combined as \emph{other non-prompt} backgrounds.

\subsection{Truth-based isolation}\label{sswwupgrade:isolation}
Since the MC samples used in this analysis have not been run through a full detector simulation, they lack any kind of particle isolation variables (since they require, for example, information on the calorimeter response).
Generally, this is not a large concern, as at truth-level, high $\pt$ signal leptons tend to be well isolated to begin with.
However, isolation is one of the most powerful tools for rejecting leptons from non-prompt sources such as top events, which are produced in association with additional nearby particles from $b$ and $c$ quark decays.
In the absence of any sort of isolation requirement, contributions from top backgrounds (including single top, $t\bar{t}$ and $t\bar{t}+V$) were more than an order of magnitude higher than expected.

As a result, it was necessary to create an analogue to the isolation information that is available in fully-simulated samples.
Track- and calorimeter-based isolation variables were constructed by summing the momentum and energy, respectively, of stable truth particles with $\pt > 1~\textrm{GeV}$ within a specified radius of each signal lepton.
For the track-based isolation, only charged truth particles were used; both charged and neutral particles (excluding neutrinos) were included for the calorimeter-based isolation.
Ultimately, a set of isolation cuts were chosen that are similar to those recommended by ATLAS for Run 2 analyses.
The truth-based isolation requirements are listed in Table~\ref{tab:truth_iso_definition}.

The truth-based isolation requirement reduced the top background by over 99\% and reduced the contribution of top events to the total background from 83\% to 2\%.  Additional details on the truth-based isolation studies are presented in Appendix~\ref{app:truth_isolation}.
