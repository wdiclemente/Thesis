Several LaTeX packages are required - I don't have a comprehensive list, but 
the main one that you may not have is PGF:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/pgf/

I have used version 2.00 to develop this document.

Please feel free to contact me in case of questions.

Thanks!

I have updated this template to be a bit more general for other users.  Put your
personal data in tex/docdefs.tex.

Build by simply calling:

    make

I've made some long overdue improvements to the template. One particular one is
that the draft and electronic versions now have exactly the same formatting
(margins, etc.) as what Penn asks for. Note that the margins are asymmetric, as
it's single-sided and bound on the left. If you want it to be symmetric for some
reason, you can modify it in style/pennThesis.cls.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

+Changed some colors to make it more like current ATLAS style
+Renamed tex folder to sections folder 
+Updated bibs (June 2018) 
+Added GitLab CI 
+Added thesis lumi plot (need pdfinfo package, I think on mac it is xpdf package), 
Note this works properly once you've been writing your thesis for more than 
6 days... Also make sure to manually change the first entry of lumi_plot/pages.csv.  

NOTE: If you use a DEBIAN system (like Ubuntu) you need to add the line
SHELL = /bin/bash at the beginning of the MakeFile as debian has
/bin/sh set as 'dash' shell rather than 'bash' 

NOTE2: To compile version for Penn, change variables 'isDraft' in 
sections/docdefs.tex and 'boolVersionForPenn' in style/pennThesis.cls
